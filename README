NAME
    Mail::Log::Exceptions - Exceptions for the Mail::Log::* modules.

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::Log::Exceptions;

      Mail::Log::Exceptions->throw(q{Error description});

DESCRIPTION
    This is a generic Exceptions module, supporting exceptions for the
    Mail::Log::* modules. At the moment it's just a thin wrapper around
    Exception::Class, with appropriate class names for this use.

    Current exceptions in this module:

    Mail::Log::Exceptions
        The root level Exception class. Generic: Avoid using.

    Mail::Log::Exceptions::InvalidParameter
        Errors due to passing the data types, not passing required data, or
        other mistakes in calling method.

    Mail::Log::Exceptions::Unimplemented
        Exception to be thrown when a called method has not been
        implimented. Typically used by base classes when defining a method
        for subclasses to override.

    Mail::Log::Exceptions::Logfile
        Errors having to do with the logfile itself: Errors opening,
        reading, etc.

    Mail::Log::Exceptions::Message
        Errors having to do with message information: Something is
        unreadable, or missing, or in bad format, etc.

    Mail::Log::Exceptions::Message::IncompleteLog
        Errors due to there being a logfile that is incomplete, or a message
        that is not entirely within this logfile.

    Classes in the module tree may define sub-classes of the above
    exceptions.
